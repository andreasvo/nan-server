# nan-server
Network + Android Hybrid app project

This project consisted of 5 milestones, whereas 1-3 was to create a server with a database(sqlite3) in C from scratch.
This was done on a Ubuntu Linux virtual machine and then the 4th milestone required a webapp html/css/js front end user interface for user interaction.
Last the 5th Milestone had this webapp be turned into a hybrid android app, where static files was in the app and the rest on the server.
